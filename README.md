# Digital-Alarm-Clock

Welcome to the FPGA Digital Alarm Clock project repository! üï∞Ô∏è

# Future Enhancements

We have exciting plans for the future of this project:

I2C LCD Interface: Move the LCD interface from 8-bit parallel to I2C for enhanced flexibility and reduced wiring complexity.

HYGRO Integration: Integrate a HYGRO sensor with an I2C interface to provide real-time temperature and humidity readings, adding a weather element to your morning routine.

Expandable Alarms: Increase the number of alarms from one to three, ensuring you never miss an important event.

Custom Alarm Sounds: Elevate your waking experience by implementing a sinusoidal wave generator for creating custom alarm sounds.

# Getting Started

# Digital-Alarm-Clock

Welcome to the FPGA Digital Alarm Clock project repository! üï∞Ô∏è

## Features

- Accurate Timekeeping: Thanks to FPGA magic, this clock keeps time with incredible precision.

- LCD Display: The crystal-clear 16x2 LCD with an 8-bit parallel interface provides a visually appealing and informative display of the time.

- Adaptive Brightness: An Ambient Light Sensor (ALS) dynamically adjusts the screen brightness, ensuring optimal visibility in any lighting condition.

- Customizable Alarms: Set a personalized alarm to wake up to your favorite tunes or sounds.

- Time Formats: Choose between 24-hour and 12-hour time formats according to your preference.

## Future Enhancements

I have exciting plans for the future of this project:

- I2C LCD Interface: Move the LCD interface from 8-bit parallel to I2C for enhanced flexibility and reduced wiring complexity.

- HYGRO Integration: Integrate a HYGRO sensor with an I2C interface to provide real-time temperature and humidity readings, adding a weather element to your morning routine.

- Expandable Alarms: Increase the number of alarms from one to three, ensuring you never miss an important event.

- Custom Alarm Sounds: Elevate your waking experience by implementing a sinusoidal wave generator for creating custom alarm sounds.
